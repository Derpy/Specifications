## What is ParselTrack

Several people came to the realization that designing tracker frontends 
and doing it right is hard, it's hard largely because nothing currently 
exists to make it easy.

So, we can get this out from the beginning, what is ParselTrack *NOT*?
ParselTrack is not a replacement or usurpation of existing trackers 
or website software.

We do have some concrete goals:

 * It is a test-bed for Torrent related technologies.

 * It is a modular service orientated architecture.

 * It is a protocol for communication between modules (e.g. the Tracker and Site).

 * It is a fully working proof of concept implementation.

 * It is hopefully useful to many people.



## Specification

This repository stores specifications and enhancement proposals for
the ParselTrack project. They are written with MarkDown formatting for
easy readability and editing directly on GitHub.

The specification is a single consistent document serving as an introduction
and reference to the project. This loosly follows the PEP model used
by the Python project, but is not set in stone or strictly followed.

For more information see: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/



## What is the current state?

To paraphrase:

"""
Well, we're just starting. The primary drivers of the project have had
several meetings and a video conference where they finalized a standard 
for PTEP-1, which is currently undergoing documentation.

We want to do this *RIGHT*, not fast, so we're concentrating on good design 
following best practices and documenting this design so the rest of the 
community can benefit regardless of the outcome of ParselTrack.
"""

TODO: update me as progress continues.
